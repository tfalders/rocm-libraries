         * @brief Rewrite KernelGraph to add index computation operations.
         *
         * This transform adds operations to compute memory offsets and
         * strides for load/store operations, so that indices do not
         * need to be completely recalculated every time when iterating
         * through a tile of data.
         *
         * Index computation operations are added before For Loops and
         * calculate the first index in the loop.
         *
         * A new ForLoopIncrement is added to the loop as well to
         * increment the index by the stride amount.
         *
         * Offset, Stride and Buffer edges are added to the DataFlow
         * portion of the Coordinate graph to keep track of the data
         * needed to perform the operations.
