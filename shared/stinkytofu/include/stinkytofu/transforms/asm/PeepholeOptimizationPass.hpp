/// Creates a peephole optimization pass that applies instruction fusion patterns
/// defined in PeepholePatterns.pattern.
///
/// This pass performs local peephole optimizations such as:
/// - Add+FMA fusion (e.g., v_add_f32 + v_fma_f32 -> v_fma_f32)
/// - Mul+Add fusion (e.g., v_mul_f32 + v_add_f32 -> v_fma_f32)
/// - Constant folding and propagation
///
/// The patterns are declared in PeepholePatterns.pattern and automatically
/// generated into C++ matcher code by the TableGen tool.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```cpp
/// PassManager pm;
/// pm.addPass(createPeepholeOptimizationPass());
/// pm.run();
/// ```
