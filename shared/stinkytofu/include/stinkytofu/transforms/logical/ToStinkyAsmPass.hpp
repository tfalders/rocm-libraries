/**
 * @brief Converts simple IR instructions to assembly instructions (1:1 mapping)
 *
 * This pass handles non-composite IR instructions that map directly to
 * a single assembly instruction. For example:
 * - VAddF32 (IR) -> v_add_f32 (assembly)
 * - VMulF32 (IR) -> v_mul_f32 (assembly)
 * - SBarrier (IR) -> s_barrier (assembly)
 *
 * Composite instructions (like VAddPKF32, VMovB64) should be expanded
 * by CompositeInstructionLoweringPass BEFORE this pass runs.
 *
 * The pass uses auto-generated IR mnemonic mappings to find the correct
 * assembly mnemonic for the target architecture.
 *
 * Now uses unified Pass infrastructure:
 * - Operates on Function -> BasicBlock -> IRList
 * - Replaces LogicalInstruction* with StinkyInstruction* in-place
 * - Integrates with PassManager
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```cpp
 * PassManager pm;
 * pm.addPass(createCompositeInstructionLoweringPass());
 * pm.addPass(createToStinkyAsmPass());
 * pm.run();
 * ```
